       <!-- poem -->
        <p>
            I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
            Who said-"Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
            Stand in the desert . . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
            Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose from, <br>
            And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>
            Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
            Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
            And on the padestal, these words appear: <br>
            My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>,  king of kings; <br>
            Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair! <br>
            Nothing besides remains. Round the decay <br>
            of thet colossal wrek, boundless and bare <br>
            The lone the level sands stetch for away." <br>
        </p>
